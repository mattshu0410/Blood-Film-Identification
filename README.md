# Blood-Film-Identification

The current process for interpreting blood films within a haematology lab involves automated haematology analysers. These machines perform blood cell counts autonomously however when a sample is flagged, the blood smear must be reviewed manually which is extremely labour intensive. Furthermore, in some rural/regional areas where haematology labs are too expensive, blood samples have to be sent to metropolitan areas to be analysed. Our overarching goal is to be able to automate the identification of diseased white blood cells within a sample using a deep learning model and present them to a haematologist for confirmation.
